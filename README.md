Image format of TextZoom dataset

'Thank you very much for the paper and data set published by the author on text super-resolution https://github.com/JasonBoy1/TextZoom '
But there is only LMDB format. I converted it to a picture format, which is more convenient. Thanks again for the contribution of the original author.

The link to the picture format is:  Data (jpg)：https://pan.baidu.com/s/1JZTIEPT23Cx0v0xfSsRnJg   password：ywt6
